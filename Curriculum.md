## Intro
I am a telecommunication Engineer born in 1991.

I started getting into Free Software and programming because it is the easiest
way for me to develop new things and use my creativity but, at the same time, I
have been working on electronics, design and arts – most of the times learning
by myself diving in the Internet. This includes: drawing, painting, sculpting,
circuit design, programming, 3D design and modelling, creative writing and
more.

I practiced martial arts (judo, aikido and karate) for years.
