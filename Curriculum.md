## Intro

I studied Telecommunication Engineering and all my career have been oriented
to data analysis for Banks.

Recently, I've been thinking about myself and I want to use the knowledge and
the tools I have to more social purposes. I'm interested on: renewable energy,
ecology, healthcare...

I'm flexible and adaptable, I learn fast and I'm not afraid of a new tool or a
new environment.

In my free time I'm making clothes for babies in order to learn to sew with a
sewing machine. Also, I'm taking guitar lessons to take advantage of the years
I took part in the local chorus of my hometown.
